**Project Title:** **Establishing and Testing a CAN Bus Connection Between Two Raspberry Pi 4B Boards**

---

### **Project Description**
The project aims to design, implement, and test a Controller Area Network (CAN) communication link between two Raspberry Pi 4B boards using CAN transceiver modules. CAN is a robust vehicle communication protocol widely used in automotive and industrial systems for real-time data exchange. This project introduces students to embedded systems communication, hardware interfacing, and debugging techniques.
