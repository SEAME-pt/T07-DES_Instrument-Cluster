### **Project Title:**
**Setting Up a Cross-Compiler on Ubuntu Host for Raspberry Pi 4B**

---

### **Project Description:**
This project focuses on setting up a cross-compilation environment on an Ubuntu host machine to develop and build applications for a Raspberry Pi 4B target. Cross-compilation allows students to build binaries on a more powerful machine (host) and run them on a less powerful target system (Raspberry Pi). This is essential for efficient development in embedded systems, where native compilation might be resource-intensive or impractical.

---

### **Learning Objectives:**

1. Understand the concept of cross-compilation and its importance in embedded systems development.
2. Learn to set up and configure a cross-compilation toolchain for Raspberry Pi.
3. Gain hands-on experience in compiling and deploying software for ARM-based architectures.
4. Explore remote development workflows, including file transfer and debugging.

---

### **Expected Deliverables:**

1. A fully configured cross-compilation environment on the Ubuntu host.
2. A sample C++ application compiled on the host and successfully executed on the Raspberry Pi 4B.
3. Documentation detailing the setup process and project workflow.
4. A demonstration of deploying and running the compiled binary on the Raspberry Pi.

### **System Requirements:**

1. **Host Machine:**
   - Ubuntu (20.04 or newer recommended).

2. **Target Device:**
   - Raspberry Pi 4B running Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit or 64-bit).

3. **Software Tools:**
   - Cross-compilation toolchain (e.g., `gcc-arm-none-eabi` or `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` for 64-bit targets).
   - File transfer tools (e.g., `scp`, `rsync`).
   - Debugging tools (e.g., `gdbserver`, `gdb`).

4. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - Raspberry Pi 4B with a microSD card.
   - Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection between the host and Raspberry Pi.
   - Power supply for the Raspberry Pi.
