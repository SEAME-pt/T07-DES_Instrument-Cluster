### **Project Title:**
**CAN Communication Between Arduino Uno R3 and Raspberry Pi 4B for Real-Time Speed Measurement**

---

### **Project Description:**
This project focuses on establishing communication between an Arduino Uno R3 and a Raspberry Pi 4B using the CAN protocol. The Arduino Uno will interface with a pulse encoder (e.g., SEN-Speed sensor) to measure rotational speed and transmit the calculated speed to the Raspberry Pi via CAN. The Raspberry Pi will display the received speed values on its standard output. The project demonstrates real-world applications of sensor data acquisition and communication in embedded systems, such as in automotive or industrial environments.
